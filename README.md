## Chat-Bot-Skip-gram
The Chat Bot Skip-Gram aims to leverage word embeddings trained via the [skip-gram](https://github.com/KHAAdotPK/Skip-gram.git) model to eventually become a fully functional chatbot capable of understanding and responding to input. As of now, the bot is focused on computing cosine similarity between words to test the quality and accuracy of the embeddings generated by the [skip-gram](https://github.com/KHAAdotPK/Skip-gram.git) implementation and stress test the implementations of the related dependencies.

Read this article for [in-depth analysis on Skip-Gram word embeddings, focusing on training dynamics, loss function behavior, and the impact of optimal parameter tuning on cosine similarity](https://github.com/KHAAdotPK/Skip-gram/blob/main/usage/README.md).

**Commands**: Here is a list of supported commands and their descriptions **...**
**Basic Commands**
- `h -h help --help ? /?`
    - Displays the help screen.
- `v -v version --version /v`
    - Displays the version number.
     
 **Vocabulary and Weights**
- `words --words`
    - Expects a list of words from the vocabulary.
- `w1 --w1`
    - Specifies the file containing trained input weights.
- `w2 --w2`
    - Specifies the file containing the vocabulary.
- `vocab --vocab`
    - Specifies the file containing the vocabulary.

**Additional Flags**
- `average`
    - Acts as a flag to be used with the **W1** option or **w1** and **W2** options... 
        - When this flag is used on its own then it implies that program will further proceed using the contents of the **W1** matrix. 
        -  When `average` is used with `do` subcommand then program proceeds using the matrix which is outcome of the average operation performed on matrix **W1** and **W2**. The average operation is done by the program itself internally.

    - **Subcommands**
        - `do` 
            This command implies that the W1 and W2 matrices will be averaged, and the program will proceed with processing the resulting matrix. Optionally expects a numeric argument, which serves as a multiplier applied to the W2 matrix before averaging.
