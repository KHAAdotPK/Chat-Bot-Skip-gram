## Chat-Bot-Skip-gram
The Chat Bot Skip-Gram aims to leverage word embeddings trained via the [skip-gram](https://github.com/KHAAdotPK/Skip-gram.git) model to eventually become a fully functional chatbot capable of understanding and responding to input. As of now, the bot is focused on computing cosine similarity between words to test the quality and accuracy of the embeddings generated by the [skip-gram](https://github.com/KHAAdotPK/Skip-gram.git) implementation and stress test the implementations of the related dependencies.
